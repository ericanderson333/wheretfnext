I'd like to build a fully functioning web application. The purpose of this application is for someone to use when they are hosting a party or gathering of some sort but after the party they don't know what location to go afterwards. This could be a bar, club, resturuant, or any location that is listed on google. I'd like the app allow the host or who ever to start a poll on where to go to next. In this poll, they could share it to the attendees by text message and/or broadcast it via QR code. When someone clicks on the text message linkn or scans qr code then they are taken to the page that allows them to search up they're favorite place whether it be a bar, resturaunt, club, etc.. One the attendess submits, their response is recorded in the system. The host who started the poll can view the results at any time after creating the poll. The results will show the rankings in order of where everyone wanted to go. Additionally, when the host creates the poll they are allowed to vote on it themselves as well. 
I'm not sure what the best coding stack might be for this. I'd like to take your suggestions on what may be best. I also would like you to generate the boilder plate code for this as well. If possible, I want the style to be similar to the app partiful for css and graphics on the website.
